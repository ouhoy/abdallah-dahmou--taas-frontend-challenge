## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
2. Add .env variables
3. Install and run the project 
   ```bash   
   npm install

   npm run dev

### Server

I have used a NodeJs Backend to generate the user's access token since I could not achieve that in the Frontend due to the CORS policy. If there is an alternative to this approach, please let me know.

1. Navigate to the `server` folder:
   ```bash
   cd server
2. Add .env variables
3. Install and run the project 
   ```bash   
   npm install

   npm run dev

#### This will start the client and server applications.
